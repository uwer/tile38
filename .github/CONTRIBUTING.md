## How to contribute to Tile38

Before getting starting with contributing, please know that we currently use [Tile38 Slack](https://tile38.com/slack) channel for casual questions and user chat.

### Did you find a bug?

- **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability in Tile38**. Sensitive security-related issues should be reported to [security@tile38.com](mailto:security@tile38.com).

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/tidwall/tile38/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/tidwall/tile38/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Tile38 will generally not be accepted.

### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

- New features will probably not be approved without prior discussion. If you need a specialized feature, make sure to express your willingness to fund the work and maintenance.
- Please do not open a pull request without filing an issue and/or discussing it with a maintainer beforehand.

Thanks!
